✅ Create store modal (components/CreateStoreModal.jsx)
✅ Status bar component (components/StatusBar.jsx)
✅ API integration layer (api.js)
✅ Configuration (config.js)
✅ Dockerized frontend with nginx (Dockerfile, nginx.conf)
✅ Vite build setup
3. Helm Charts
✅ Platform Chart (platform)
API deployment
Dashboard deployment
Ingress configuration
RBAC setup
✅ WooCommerce Store Chart (woocommerce)
WordPress deployment
MySQL StatefulSet
Services (WordPress + MySQL)
PVCs for persistent storage
Secrets management
Ingress per store
WP setup job (initialization)
Both local and prod values files
4. Infrastructure Scripts
✅ Local setup script (setup-local.sh)
✅ Production setup script (setup-prod.sh)
✅ Teardown script (teardown-local.sh)
✅ Image loading for Kind (load-images-to-kind.sh)
✅ Ingress controller config (ingress-controller.yaml)
❌ What Needs to Be Implemented
Critical (Must Have for Submission)
1. MedusaJS Store Support
 Create helm/medusa/ chart directory
 MedusaJS backend deployment
 PostgreSQL StatefulSet
 Redis deployment (optional but recommended)
 Medusa storefront (Next.js) deployment
 Services, Ingress, PVCs, Secrets
 values-local.yaml and values-prod.yaml
 Initialization job for Medusa setup
2. End-to-End Testing
 Test WooCommerce flow:

Create store via dashboard
Verify store is accessible
Add product to cart
Complete checkout (COD/test gateway)
Verify order in WP admin
Delete store and verify cleanup
 Test MedusaJS flow (same as above)

3. Documentation
 README.md with:

Prerequisites (Docker, kubectl, Helm, Kind/k3d)
Local setup instructions (step-by-step)
VPS/k3s production setup
How to create a store and place an order
Troubleshooting section
 ARCHITECTURE.md covering:

System design diagram
Component responsibilities
Data flow (create → provision → ready → delete)
Idempotency strategy
Failure handling approach
Local vs Production differences
Security considerations
Scaling approach
4. Kubernetes Features
 Readiness/Liveness Probes in:

Platform API deployment
Platform Dashboard deployment
WordPress deployment
MedusaJS deployment
 Resource Requests/Limits for all deployments

 Namespace-per-store isolation (verify implementation)

 Clean teardown logic (verify all resources deleted)

5. Security Hardening
 Verify no hardcoded secrets in source code
 Secret generation logic in orchestrator
 RBAC verification (least privilege)
 Non-root containers where possible
 Security contexts in pod specs
Important (Strongly Recommended)
6. Production VPS Deployment
 Deploy to k3s on VPS (AWS/GCP free tier)
 Document DNS/domain setup
 Test with production values
 Optional: cert-manager for TLS
 Optional: Custom domain linking feature
7. Observability
 Activity logs in dashboard (store events)
 Provisioning duration metrics
 Failure reason display in UI
 Basic health checks endpoint
8. Abuse Prevention
 Rate limiting (per IP or user)
 Store quota per user (max stores)
 Provisioning timeouts
 Audit logging (who created/deleted what)
9. Resilience Features
 Idempotency verification (retry-safe operations)
 Provisioning recovery after controller restart
 Clear failure states and error messages
 Graceful degradation
10. Multi-tenant Guardrails
 ResourceQuota per store namespace
 LimitRange per store namespace
 Max PVC size limits
 NetworkPolicies (deny-by-default)
Nice to Have (Stand Out)
11. Horizontal Scaling
 HPA for platform API
 HPA for dashboard (if applicable)
 Concurrency controls in orchestrator
 Document stateful constraints
12. Upgrades & Rollback
 Helm upgrade strategy documentation
 Rollback procedure
 Zero-downtime upgrade approach
13. Advanced Features
 Custom domain linking in dashboard
 Store cloning functionality
 Backup/restore for stores
 Cost tracking per store
Demo Video Requirements ⚠️
You must record a comprehensive demo covering:

System Design (5-7 mins)

Architecture diagram walkthrough
Component responsibilities
Data flow explanation
Live Demo (10-15 mins)

Local setup from scratch
Create WooCommerce store
Create MedusaJS store
Show both stores running concurrently
Place order in each store
Delete a store and verify cleanup
Deep Dive (10-15 mins)

Show Kubernetes resources (kubectl get all -n store-xyz)
Explain isolation strategy
Show secrets handling
Demonstrate idempotency
Show failure recovery (kill a pod, watch it recover)
Production Story (5 mins)

What changes in values-prod.yaml
Ingress/DNS strategy
Storage class differences
Secrets management approach
Security & Scaling (5 mins)

RBAC explanation
Resource limits/quotas
Horizontal scaling plan
Abuse prevention measures
Immediate Action Items (Today!)
Priority 1: Make it Work
✅ Test WooCommerce provisioning end-to-end
⚠️ Build MedusaJS Helm chart (4-6 hours)
⚠️ Test MedusaJS provisioning end-to-end
✅ Fix any bugs in orchestrator/API
✅ Add readiness/liveness probes
Priority 2: Documentation
⚠️ Write comprehensive README.md (2 hours)
⚠️ Write ARCHITECTURE.md (2 hours)
✅ Add inline code comments
Priority 3: Demo Video
⚠️ Record demo video (MUST DO - 30-45 mins long)
⚠️ Test everything in video script beforehand
Priority 4: Submission
⚠️ Push to GitHub with clean commit history
⚠️ Submit form before 11:59 PM IST today
Time Estimate
Given it's 13 February 2026 (submission deadline today):

MedusaJS implementation: 4-6 hours
Testing & bug fixes: 2-3 hours
Documentation: 3-4 hours
Demo video: 2-3 hours (including retakes)
Buffer for issues: 2 hours
Total: ~15-18 hours (all-nighter required!)

Focus on WooCommerce only if time is too tight. Document MedusaJS as "architecture supports it, implement in same pattern" and prioritize a polished demo.
