Build a small “store provisioning platform” that runs on local Kubernetes but is designed so the same Helm-based deployment can run in production (for example, on a VPS box running k3s) with configuration changes only.
plan this problem's implementation for scalable system..i need system design concepts included as well wrt to kubernetes and helm so that it doesnt fail in production, 
User flow should be:
As a user, I should be able to:
Open a Node Dashboard (React web app).


View existing stores and their status.


-Click Create New Store.
-The system provides a functioning ecommerce store automatically.
-I can provision multiple stores concurrently.
-Each store can be either:
(WooCommerce (WordPress + WooCommerce), or
MedusaJS - i dont know what this is since i dont want to use wordpress instead i know react and stuff)
-The dashboard shows for each store:
-status (Provisioning / Ready / Failed)
-store URL(s)
-created timestamp
-I can delete a store and all resources are cleaned up.

This is mandatory requirement by client-
Must run on local Kubernetes (Kind / k3d / Minikube).
Must be deployable to a production-like VPS setup (k3s is fine) using the same Helm charts.
Helm is mandatory (no Kustomize). Local vs production differences must be handled via Helm values (e.g., values-local.yaml, values-prod.yaml).
Provisioning must be Kubernetes-native (Deployments/StatefulSets, Services, Ingress, PVCs, Secrets, Jobs/Controllers).
Multi-store capability with isolation (namespace-per-store preferred).
Persistent storage for the database at minimum.
Each store exposed via HTTP using Ingress with stable URLs (document your local domain approach).
Basic readiness/liveness checks.
Clean teardown: deleting a store removes its resources safely.
No hardcoded secrets in source code.
